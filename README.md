## More than just a game

Hex is also part of a scientific research project: Math and programming in Hex.

The project had the objective of study and apply analytical geometry (and math, in general), Game Theory and artificial intelligence concepts on game development.

It's a different way to learn those field of study. You can check this [wiki page][wiki] to see for yourself and learn math and programming in an interesting way.

There is also a portuguese pdf made at the end of the scientific research project, check it out [here][pdf].
